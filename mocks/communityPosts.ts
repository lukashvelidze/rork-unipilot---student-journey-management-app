    content: "I've been studying in Munich for 3 months now, and I wanted to share some cultural differences that surprised me. The punctuality is real - if a class starts at 9:00, it starts EXACTLY at 9:00. Stores are closed on Sundays, which took some getting used to. Germans are more direct in communication than I expected. Public transportation is amazing. Recycling is taken very seriously. Anyone else experience culture shock in their host country?",
