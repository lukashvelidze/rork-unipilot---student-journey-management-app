# Crash Fix Summary - UniPilot App

## Issue Description
The app was crashing on startup with a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) in the Hermes JavaScript engine when trying to define object properties during initialization.

**Crash Details:**
- Exception: `EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)` 
- Location: `hermes::vm::JSObject::defineOwnComputedPrimitive`
- Thread: JavaScript thread (Thread 10)
- Incident ID: `1C1FAB8F-4F3A-486C-8C38-6A9566C6A465`

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Configuration Conflicts
- **JS Engine Mismatch**: `app.json` specified `"jsEngine": "jsc"` but build was using Hermes
- **New Architecture**: `newArchEnabled: true` can cause compatibility issues with certain dependencies
- **Entry Point Issues**: Conflicting main entry point configuration

### 2. Initialization Issues
- User store initialization could fail without proper error handling
- Font loading errors could block app startup
- No graceful error handling during critical startup processes

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Configuration Fixes

**app.json changes:**
```json
// Removed problematic configurations
- "newArchEnabled": true,
- "expo": {
-   "jsEngine": "jsc"
- },
+ "newArchEnabled": false,
```

**package.json:**
- Ensured correct entry point: `"main": "expo-router/entry"`

### 2. Entry Point Cleanup
- Removed unused `index.js` import logic
- Deleted conflicting App.tsx file
- Properly configured for Expo Router

### 3. Error Handling Improvements

**_layout.tsx:**
- Added async error handling for user initialization
- Added fallback for font loading errors
- Prevent splash screen blocking on font errors

**userStore.ts:**
- Added try-catch in `initializeUser` function
- Graceful error handling to prevent app crashes
- Proper error state management

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Clean Build**: Delete `node_modules`, clear Expo cache, and rebuild
2. **Device Testing**: Test on multiple iOS devices and versions
3. **Startup Monitoring**: Monitor app startup performance and error logs
4. **Gradual Feature Testing**: Test each major feature independently

## Commands to Run

```bash
# Clean everything
rm -rf node_modules
expo prebuild --clean
npx expo install --fix

# Rebuild
npm install
expo run:ios

# If still having issues, try development client
expo run:ios --device
```

## Prevention Measures

1. **Always test major configuration changes on device builds**
2. **Use error boundaries for critical initialization code**
3. **Keep new architecture disabled until all dependencies are compatible**
4. **Monitor crash reports closely after releases**
5. **Implement proper logging for startup processes**

## Dependencies to Watch

These dependencies might need updates if issues persist:
- `react-native` (0.79.5)
- `react` (19.0.0) 
- `expo` (53.0.19)
- `@paddle/paddle-js` (check native module compatibility)

## Additional Notes

- The crash was happening in the Hermes engine during property definition
- This typically indicates memory management issues or null pointer access
- New Architecture (`newArchEnabled`) is still experimental and can cause issues
- Always test production builds on physical devices before App Store submission
